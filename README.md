```


### Compile and run

To run a solution, you need to provide some arguments.
* the `--year` flag must be set to specify the year of the challenge
* the `--day` flag must be set to specify which day's solution should run
* the `--part` flag specifies if you only want to run a specific part. by default both parts will run

make command:

```sh
make run year=2023 day=13
```

go command:

```sh
go run main.go --year=2023 --day=13
```
